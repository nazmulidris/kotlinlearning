# kotlinlearning

This is a project with sample code that I created while I was learning Kotlin. They are based
on the samples from [Kotlin in Action book](https://livebook.manning.com/#!/book/kotlin-in-action/chapter-2/121)
and from the [try.kotlinlang.org](https://try.kotlinlang.org/#/Examples/Hello,%20world!/Simplest%20version/Simplest%20version.kt) 
website.

## Importing this project into Jetbrains IntelliJ IDEA

- This project was created using Jetbrains Idea as a Gradle and Kotlin project
([more info](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/getting-started-with-gradle.html)).
    - When you import this project into Idea as a Gradle project, make sure not to check "Offline
work" (which if checked, won't allow the gradle dependencies to be downloaded).
    - As of Jun 24 2018, Java 10 doesn't work w/ this gradle distribution, so you can use Java 8.
