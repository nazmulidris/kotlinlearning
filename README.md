# kotlinlearning

This is a project with sample code that I created while I was learning Kotlin. They are based
on the samples from [Kotlin in Action book](https://livebook.manning.com/#!/book/kotlin-in-action/chapter-2/121)
and from the [try.kotlinlang.org](https://try.kotlinlang.org/#/Examples/Hello,%20world!/Simplest%20version/Simplest%20version.kt) 
website.
